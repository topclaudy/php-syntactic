# PHP Syntactic Sugar for named and indexed parameters call.

PHP lacks support for named parameters call. **Syntactic** brings named and indexed parameter call support for user
defined functions and methods of user defined classes (including class constructor).

**Syntactic** allows you to specify parameters in arbitrary order by name or position/index when calling functions and methods
without worrying about default values for their parameters (skipping the ones you don't want to specify). This would
allow to define functions and methods which could accept wider ranges of parameters without resorting to using arrays and
complicated checks. The parameters/arguments of your functions and methods remain documentable using standard PHPDoc notation.


## Installation

The recommended way to install **Syntactic** is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)

```bash
$ composer require awobaz/syntactic
```
**_Syntactic_** requires PHP 5.6 or later.

## Usage

**Syntactic** provides helpers/wrappers functions and a trait to make your functions and methods _syntacticable_.
After installation the _**syntactic**_ and _**s**_ helpers are available (_**s**_ is an alias for _**syntactic**_). Those who
prefer trait may use the _**Syntacticable**_ trait.

The helpers create _syntacticable_ objects. You can then use the methods _**in**_ and _**inRef**_ to pass (input) parameters by
value or reference. The method _**out**_ is used to execute the function/method. The methods _**in**_, **_inRef_**, _**out**_
are chainable but the method _**out**_ should always be the last call in the chain (see examples below).

The methods **_with_** and **_withRef_** are aliases for _**in**_ and **_inRef_** respectively.


### Usage with user defined functions

Consider the following function which computes the product of its 4 arguments (a, b, c and d):
```php
function foo($a = 1, $b = 2, $c = 3, $d = 4){
    return $a * $b * $c * $d;
}
```
With _Syntactic_, you may call this function passing and skipping arguments using a chainable syntax:

```php
//Call with argument b only
echo s('foo')->in('b', 5)->out(); //Outputs 60

//Call with argument a and argument at index/position 1 (b),
echo s('foo')->in('a', 7)->in(1, 5)->out(); //Outputs 420

//Call with argument c only through dynamic method
echo s('foo')->c(9)->out(); //Outputs 72
```

#### **Explanation**

Let's explain the construction ```s('foo')->in('a', 7)->in(1, 5)->out();```

1. We use the helper _**s**_, ```s('foo')```, to create a _syntacticable_ object from the function _foo_. The _**s**_ helper accepts the name of a function, an
object or the name of a class as argument. Here we pass the name of the function _foo_ as a string.

2. We call the method **_in_** to specify the arguments we want without worrying about the order and default value of the other arguments.
(use **_inRef_** or **_withRef_** to pass argument by reference). Note that we can refer to arguments by their name  or position (as defined in the function signature).
Here we pass the parameter _$a_ using its name, and the parameter _$b_ using its position. Position/index starts at 0 (zero).

3. We finally call the method **_out_** to execute the function _foo_.

For convenience, parameters names are also exposed as methods. The construction:

```php
s('foo')->in('a', 7)->in(1, 5)->out();
```

is equivalent to:

```php
s('foo')->a(7)->b(5)->out();
```

### Usage with object/class methods.

The syntax for object/class methods is a bit different. You must refer to the methods as object/class property before you
call **_in_** (or **_inRef_**) to pass parameters.

```php

class MyClass {
	public function foo($a = 1, $b = 2, $c = 3, $d = 4){
		return $a * $b * $c * $d;
	}

	public static function bar($a = 1, $b = 2, $c = 3, $d = 4){
		return $a * $b * $c * $d;
	}
}

$myObj = new MyClass();

//Call the instance method foo
echo s($myObj)->foo->in('c', 8)->in('a', 1)->out(); //Outputs 64
echo s($myObj)->foo->in(0, 1)->in(2, 8)->out(); //Outputs 64
echo s($myObj)->foo->a(1)->c(8)->out(); //Outputs 64

//Call the static method bar
echo s('MyClass')->bar->in('b', 5)->out(); //Outputs 60
echo s('MyClass')->bar->in(1, 5)->out(); //Outputs 60
echo s('MyClass')->bar->b(5)->out(); //Outputs 60
```
When calling static methods, it is recommended to use the fully qualified name of the class if you use namespaces.

#### **Using with class constructor**

Consider the following class:

```php
class Bar
{
    protected $a;
    protected $b;
    protected $c;
    protected $d;

    public function __construct($a = 1, $b = 2, $c = 3, $d = 4)
    {
        $this->a = $a;
        $this->b = $b;
        $this->c = $c;
        $this->d = $d;
    }

    public function getProduct(){
        return $this->a * $this->b * $this->c * $this->d;
    }
}
```

We can instantiate new object of this class using the _**newInstance**_ method and only specify the arguments we want for
the constructor in an arbitrary order:

```php
//Creates and instance of Bar
$obj = s('Bar')->newInstance()->b(6)->d(8)->out();
//Call a method on the instance
echo $obj->getProduct(); //Outputs 144
```

#### **Calling methods directly on _syntacticable_ objects**

You may call a method directly on a syntacticable object by passing an array of named or indexed parameters.

Consider the following class:

```php
class FooBar
{
    public function foo($a, $b = 2, $c = 3, $d = 4)
	{
		return $a * $b * $c * $d;
	}

	public static function bar($a, $b = 2, $c = 3, $d = 4)
	{
		return $a * $b * $c * $d;
	}

	public static function hello(){
		echo "Hello World!";
	}
}
```

We can call the method _foo_ on in instance:

```php
$obj = new FooBar();
echo s($obj)->foo(array('a'=>5, 'c'=>4)); //Outputs 160
```

We can call the static method _bar_:

```php
echo s('FooBar')->bar(array('a'=>5, 'c'=>4)); //Outputs 160
```

Methods without arguments should be called without arguments:

```php
echo s('FooBar')->hello(); //Prints 'Hello World!"
```

### Using the _Syntacticable_ trait

When using the _Syntacticable_ trait, all the instance methods of the class become _syntacticable_. This is useful when you don't want
to use the helpers. The trait doesn't support static methods.

Keep in mind that the _Syntacticable_ trait overrides the PHP magic method **__get**. You can't use the trait if a class
overrides this method.

Example using the _Syntacticable_ trait

```php

class MyClass {
	use Awobaz\Syntactic\Syntacticable;

	public function foo($a = 1, $b = 2, $c = 3, $d = 4){
		return $a * $b * $c * $d;
	}

	public static function bar($a = 1, $b = 2, $c = 3, $d = 4){
		return $a * $b * $c * $d;
	}
}
```
Thanks to the _Syntacticable_ trait, the instance methods are exposed as properties on the class instances, then you can call them in a _syntacticable_ way.

```php
$myObj = new MyClass();

//Call the instance method foo
echo $myObj->foo->in('c', 8)->in('a', 1)->out(); //Outputs 64
echo $myObj->foo->in(0, 1)->in(2, 8)->out(); //Outputs 64
echo $myObj->foo->a(1)->c(8)->out(); //Outputs 64
```

## Limitations

You can use _**Syntactic**_ with internal (built-in) PHP functions, but you can't skip arguments if they are not at the
end of the arguments list of the functions. Otherwise, things will not work as expected.

The following examples will work because the optional arguments for the built-in functions _sort_ _and preg__replace are
at the end of the arguments list.

```php
$t = array(1, 6, 9, 3, 8, 2);
s('sort')->inRef(0, $t)->out();
```

```php
$string = 'April 15, 2003';
$pattern = '/(\w+) (\d+), (\d+)/i';
$replacement = '${1}1,$3';
$count = 0;
echo s('preg_replace')->in(0, $pattern)->in(1, $replacement)->in(2, $string)->out();
```

while the example below won't work.

```php
$string = 'April 15, 2003';
$pattern = '/(\w+) (\d+), (\d+)/i';
$replacement = '${1}1,$3';
$count = 0;
echo s('preg_replace')->in(0, $pattern)->in(1, $replacement)->in(2, $string)->inRef(4, $count)->out();
```
For this to work, we need to specify the value for the optional parameter _limit_ (at index 3):

```php
echo s('preg_replace')->in(0, $pattern)->in(1, $replacement)->in(2, $string)->in(3, 1)->inRef(4, $count)->out();
```

Due to PHP's Reflection implementation details, it is not possible to get the default value of built-in functions or
methods of built-in classes. We strongly recommend to use _Syntactic_ only with user defined functions and methods of
user defined classes.
